# Obesity Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project, led by Federico Vargas, Pilar Ordás, Almudena Corella, Alberto Tapia, Gabriel Zamora, and Iker Yáñez, serves as the final group project for the Master's in Big Data Science program at the University of Navarra. Leveraging advanced Deep Learning techniques, the project aims to develop predictive models for classification, specifically targeting the classification of health insurance customers. The objective is to accurately classify customers based on their health-related attributes, enabling insurance companies to offer personalized insurance premiums. Through structured data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes, combined with real-world deployment strategies, the project aims to significantly contribute to insurance companies' ability to provide tailored healthcare coverage.

## Running the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment with Python 3.9.18

You can use your preferred tool for creating virtual environments.

### 2. Install Poetry in the Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions at [Poetry Official Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) to install Poetry in your virtual environment.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install all project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will read the pyproject.toml file and install all the dependencies required for the project.

### 4. Run Notebooks

With all dependencies installed, you are now ready to run any notebook in the project.
