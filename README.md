# Obesity Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project, led by Federico Vargas, Pilar Ordas, Almudena Corella, Alberto Tapia, Gabriel Zamora and Iker Ya√±ez, serves as the final group endeavor for the Master's in Big Data Science program at the University of Navarra. By leveraging advanced Deep Learning techniques, the project aims to develop predictive models for identifying individuals at risk of obesity early on, thus enabling targeted interventions and personalized healthcare approaches. Through structured data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes, coupled with real-world deployment strategies, the project seeks to make significant contributions to preventive healthcare strategies, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## Running the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment with Python 3.9.18

You can use your preferred tool for creating virtual environments.

### 2. Install Poetry in the Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions at [Poetry Official Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) to install Poetry in your virtual environment.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install all project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will read the pyproject.toml file and install all the dependencies required for the project.

### 4. Run Notebooks

With all dependencies installed, you are now ready to run any notebook in the project.
